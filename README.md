# IOT System: *Simple Home Security System Using Motion Detection*

This IOT system logs each time that the motion sensor detects motion. The IOT system comes with a barebones
web application which features the following:
  1) The list of timestamps that the motion detection detected
  2) A bar graph that visualizes the motion detected per hour

In the timestamp list, the user is able to **_delete_** entries.
The timestamps are formatted by **MM/DD/YYYY, HH:MM:SS AM/PM**.

In order to use the system, the user needs the following components:
  1) Arduino WeMos D1 R1
  2) Mini PIR Motion Sensor
  3) M to F Jumper Wires (at least 3)
  4) Micro-USB Cable

Below is the components' architecture:
